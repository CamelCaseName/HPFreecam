# HPFreecam
##### The freecam mod for House Party by Eek! Games (now with third person and orthographic mode!)
<hr>

Get it [here](https://github.com/CamelCaseName/HPFreecam/releases/latest). 

You can use the freecam itself to take nice pictures and whatnot (TAB[defaut] to disable the ingame UI).
To use third person mode, you need to activate the freecam using alt+f, then the third person camera using alt+t. This setting will be saved, so whenever you start the game from now on, you'll start in third person mode.
